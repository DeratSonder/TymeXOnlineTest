# Kotlin Android Project Setup Guide

This document provides a step-by-step guide to clone, set up, and run an Android project written in **Kotlin** from a Git repository.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Android Studio** installed (latest version recommended).
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** version 8 or higher.
- **Git** installed on your system.
- **Kotlin Plugin** installed in Android Studio (Android Studio comes with Kotlin support by default).

### Installation Instructions

Follow the steps below to clone and set up the Android project:

## 1. Clone the Repository

To begin, you need to clone the project repository to your local machine. Open a terminal (or command prompt) and run the following command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:DeratSonder/TymeXOnlineTest.git
```

## 2. Run Challenge 01
- Open Android Studio.
- Navigate to the CurrencyConverter folder in your cloned project.
- Open the CurrencyConverter module.
- Sync the project with Gradle files by clicking File > Sync Project with Gradle Files.
- Run the app on your physical device or emulator:
  + Select your preferred device or emulator from the Android Studio toolbar.
  + Click the Run button (green triangle) to launch the app.
Test the app to ensure it is functioning as expected.

## 3. Run Challenge 02
### 3.1 Running Question 1.1 and Question 2.2
- You can run Challenge 02 questions in any Kotlin IDE, but Android Studio is recommended for a better development experience.

- To run the code in Android Studio:

- Navigate to the files for Question 1.1 and Question 2.2.
- Right-click on the file and select Run from the context menu. This will compile and execute the Kotlin code.
- If you prefer another Kotlin IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA), simply open the project in your chosen IDE and run the respective files.
